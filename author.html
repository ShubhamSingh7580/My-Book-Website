              Shubham Singh, born on November 29, 2003, into a modest
              middle-class family, is a young man driven by a passion to make
              his life extraordinary. From a young age, he possessed a
              deep-rooted curiosity to understand the world around him and learn
              something new. At every turn in life, Shubham realized that the
              most crucial aspect of success is setting goals. However, this
              task, as simple as it sounds, is often challenging for many.
              Numerous people struggle to understand how to set goals in their
              lives and pursue them. This became a source of inspiration for
              Shubham, leading him to share his experiences and knowledge with
              others so they too could achieve their dreams. <br />

              Shubham believes that if you want to succeed in life, you must
              continuously learn new things. Every day of his life is a
              testament to this principle. He learns new skills, applies them to
              his life, and it is these experiences that have helped him write
              this book. He has also observed that people shy away from setting
              goals because they fear failure or rejection. Hence, through his
              book, "If You Don't Have Goals, You Are Not Alive", he has tried
              to explain this process in a simple and effective manner. <br />

              The purpose of this book is to guide readers towards a life filled
              with clarity, focus, and motivated energy. For Shubham, setting
              goals is not just a process but a vital tool for directing one's
              life. He has not only explained the importance of goal setting in
              this book but has also delved deep into how to do it effectively.
              Shubham believes that the true measure of success lies in how you
              set and achieve your goals.
              <br />

              Every individual has the potential to do something extraordinary;
              all it takes is recognizing that potential and working towards it
              in the right direction. Through his knowledge and experiences,
              Shubham Singh aims to inspire readers to shape their lives around
              their goals and take steps towards a better life. His book is an
              essential guide for anyone seeking clarity, success, and happiness
              in their lives.
